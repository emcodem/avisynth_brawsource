Windows only, Avisynth+ Source Plugin using Blackmagic RAW SDK.

If Blackmagic employees find something they don't like here, please contact post [at] ffastrans.com and we will sort out the issues.

Regarding the LGPL license, i just followed the example from ffmpeg decklink integration. I know nothing about licenses but i would like my work to remain as free as possible.

This Plugin was made mainly for automated use in [FFAStrans](https://ffastrans.com/) but can of course be used generally in Avisynth scripts.
Please use the FFAStrans forum chat to contact me, Issues here will not be viewed very frequently.

See brawsource.cpp for build instructions, developers will need to download Blackmagic RAW SDK.
My BlackmagicRawAPI.idl file says version(0.1), it is from 2024
